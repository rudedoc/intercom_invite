# IntercomInvite

Technical problem

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON
lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food
and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names
and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
- You must use the first formula from this Wikipedia article to calculate distance. Don't
forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.
- The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.339428, -6.257664.
- You can find the Customer list here.

We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to
structure components in a small program. Good submissions are well composed. Calculating
distances and reading from a file are separate concerns. Classes or functions have clearly
defined responsibilities. Poor submissions will be in the form of one big function. Itâ€™s impossible
to test anything smaller than the entire operation of the program, including reading from the
input file.

`output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).`
